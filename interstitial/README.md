Flurry Interstitial (full-screen) Ad Integration
===============================================

This module shows how to integrate various kinds of interstitial ads into your apps using Flurry.

For this sample, a trial API key and various ad space names are already configured. Do not forget
to change the ad space name and API key if copying code from here.

The various interstitial configurations in this sample are:
 - `InterstitialTest`: The bare minimum default for an interstitial ad space configuration
 - `SkippableVideoTest`: An ad space that shows skippable videos
 - `UnskippableVideoTest`: An ad space that shows unskippable videos
 - `ClientSideRewardedAd`: An ad space that is set up to receive client-side rewarded video ads.
